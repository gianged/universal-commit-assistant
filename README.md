## Token Cost Analysis

Universal Commit Assistant is designed to be cost-effective while providing high-quality commit messages.

### Typical Token Usage

**Standard Analysis (current baseline):**
- ~1,000-2,300 tokens per commit
- Includes: file list, basic diff (2000 chars), prompts

**Enhanced Analysis (with deep features):**
- ~1,800-3,200 tokens per commit
- Includes: file list, statistics, enhanced diff (3000 chars), file categorization

### Cost per Commit by Provider

Based on enhanced analysis (~2,500 input tokens + 150 output tokens average):

| Provider | Model | Cost per Commit | Cost per 100 Commits |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5 Mini | ~$0.0005 | ~$0.05 |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5 | ~$0.008 | ~$0.80 |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | ~$0.003 | ~$0.30 |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | ~$0.010 | ~$1.00 |
| **DeepSeek** | deepseek-chat | ~$0.0009 | ~$0.09 |
| **Gemini** | 2.5 Flash | ~$0.0003 | ~$0.03 |
| **Ollama/LM Studio** | Local Models | **FREE** | **FREE** |

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Cost-Effective Providers**: Gemini Flash, DeepSeek, and GPT-5 Mini offer excellent quality at low cost
2. **Adjust Max Diff Length**: Reduce `maxDiffLength` to 2000 for simpler commits
3. **Local Models**: Use Ollama or LM Studio for completely free operation
4. **Smart Defaults**: The extension uses intelligent truncation to minimize tokens while preserving context

**Bottom Line**: Even with premium models, most users spend less than $1/month on commit message generation.
